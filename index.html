    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/download.png" width="300" height="300" alt="Haig Bedros Pics">

    <p>I wake up and I have an onion bagel with cream cheese with some crushed peppers, 
        sided with honey yogurt, some blueberry and granola. 
        Of course, with a hot cup of coffee. 
        I work remotely for PicsArt as a Localization Specialist. I'm Responsible for the localization 
        (translation & cultural adaptation) of assigned 
        console and handheld descriptions, notifications and blogs from English to Arabic, 
        adapting texts to strict character limits while retaining original meaning and flavor as much as possible.
        So work and studying are my first hours activity of the day and then I head out to my daily workout. 
        I've been working out for a few years and it became part of my dailey routine.
