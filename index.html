        I wake up and I have an onion bagel with cream cheese with some crushed peppers, 
        sided with honey yogurt, some blueberry and granola. 
        Of course, with a hot cup of coffee.

        I work remotely for PicsArt as a Localization Specialist. I'm Responsible for the localization 
        (translation and cultural adaptation) of assigned console and handheld descriptions, notifications and blogs from English to Arabic, 
        adapting texts to strict character limits while retaining original meaning and flavor as much as possible.

        So work and studying are my first hours activity of the day and then I head out to my daily workout. 
        I've been working out for a few years and it became part of my dailey routine.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. 
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
